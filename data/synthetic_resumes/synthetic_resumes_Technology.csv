ecurezza del codice
Il codice rappresenta le funzionalità e le tecniche utilizzate per il codice sicuro. La sicurezza del codice è un concetto complesso che si concentra su diversi aspetti come la mancanza di vulnerabilità, l'analisi dei rischi e l'adeguatezza delle procedure di sicurezza nel contesto di codifica. In particolare, il codice sicuro dovrebbe essere:

1. Autenticato: Garantire che solo i utenti autorizzati siano in grado di accedere ai dati critici e alle risorse del sistema.

2. Autorizzato: Imporre limiti al ruolo degli utenti e garantire che solo l'accesso necessario sia consentito.

3. Seguibile: Registrare ogni azione avvenuta all'interno del sistema per monitoraggio e analisi eventuali intrusioni o anomalie.

4. Consapevole: Evitare l'utilizzo di tecniche di codifica semplicistiche che facilitano l'infiltrazione o il furto.

5. Diversificato: Utilizzare un multipunto di protezione (sempre più di una mossa da fare per contrastare una minaccia) per rendere il sistema più resistentemente alla violazione.

6. Riservato: Mantenere i dettagli tecnici del codice protetti e inaccessibili ai non amministratori.

7. Analizzato: Implementare procedure di analisi del codice per scoprire eventuali vulnerabilità o bug prima che possano essere usate per un danno.

8. Documentato: Archiviare e registrare tutte le modifiche apportate al codice in modo che possano essere ricollegate ad eventuali problemi futuri.

9. Testato: Sottoporre continuamente il codice alla verifica e allo testing per assicurarsi che sia robusto e resistente.

Ripeto che un codice sicuro non può essere ottenuto in fretta e senza esame approfondito. Bisogna dedicare tempo a progettare, implementare e mantenere una struttura sicura. Questo implica una collaborazione continua tra i professionisti del codice, gli amministratori del sistema e i responsabili di sicurezza.",Technology,4
