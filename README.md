# Running the Application
## Install Dependencies
In a Python virtual environment or otherwise using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In a Conda environment the above is also possible, but for Conda's environment solver:
From the base directory:
```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
## Spinning up the app
The easiest start is running:
```bash
python backend/app.py
```
From the base directory. This starts the flask server in debug mode, and after a moment serves the app @ `http://localhost:5000`
